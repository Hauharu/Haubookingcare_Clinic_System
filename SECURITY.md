## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately by:
- Creating a [private security advisory](../../security/advisories/new) on GitHub, or
- Contacting me via email: trunghauu71@gmail.com

We will respond as soon as possible and keep you updated on the status of the report.
